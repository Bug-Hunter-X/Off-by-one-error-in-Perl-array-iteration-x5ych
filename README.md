This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Perl when iterating over arrays using foreach and the $#array construct. The bug.pl file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.pl offers a corrected version.  The error arises because $#array returns the index of the last element, not the number of elements. When the array is empty, $#array is -1, resulting in an error when attempting to access the array with a negative index.
